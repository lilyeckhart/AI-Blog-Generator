# Deploying AI Blog Generator to Netlify

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Netlify account (free tier works great!)
- Your backend should be running on Render or another hosting service

## Method 1: Deploy via GitHub (Recommended)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Initialize git in your project folder:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Revamped AI Blog Generator"
   ```
3. Connect to your GitHub repo:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy on Netlify
1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com/](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
4. Authorize Netlify to access your repositories
5. Select your repository
6. Configure build settings (should auto-detect):
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `build`
7. Click "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Update Backend CORS
After deployment, you'll get a Netlify URL like `https://your-app-name.netlify.app`

You need to add this URL to your backend's CORS allowed origins:
1. Open `server/index.js` in your backend
2. Add your Netlify URL to the `allowedOrigins` array:
   ```javascript
   const allowedOrigins = [
       "https://ai-blog-generator-frontend-kes5.onrender.com",
       "https://your-app-name.netlify.app",  // Add this
       "http://localhost:3000",
       "http://localhost:3001"
   ];
   ```
3. Push the changes to your backend repository
4. Render will auto-redeploy with new CORS settings

## Method 2: Deploy via Netlify CLI

### Step 1: Install Netlify CLI
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### Step 2: Login to Netlify
```bash
netlify login
```

### Step 3: Build Your App
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 4: Deploy
```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

Follow the prompts to complete the deployment.

## Method 3: Drag and Drop (Quick Test)

### Step 1: Build Your App
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Deploy
1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. Drag and drop your `build` folder
3. Done! (But note: updates require manual re-deployment)

## Important Notes

### Environment Variables
Since your API key is in the backend, you don't need to set any environment variables in Netlify for the frontend.

### Custom Domain (Optional)
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to "Domain settings"
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the instructions to point your domain to Netlify

### Continuous Deployment
When using Method 1 (GitHub), every push to your main branch will automatically trigger a new deployment!

### Backend URL
The frontend is already configured to use:
- `http://localhost:5000/generate` in development
- `https://ai-blog-generator-backend-ghav.onrender.com/generate` in production

Make sure your backend allows requests from your new Netlify URL!

---

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Errors
If you get CORS errors after deployment:
1. Check that your Netlify URL is added to backend's allowed origins
2. Redeploy your backend after making CORS changes
3. Clear browser cache and try again

### Build Failures
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check Node version compatibility (should use Node 18+)
- Look at the build logs in Netlify for specific errors

### App Not Loading
- Check that the publish directory is set to `build`
- Ensure `_redirects` file is in the `public` folder
- Verify build completed successfully
